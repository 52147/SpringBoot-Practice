## **Explain the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller` in Spring Boot.**
   - `@Controller` is used to define a controller in Spring MVC. It typically returns a view (like a JSP page).
   - `@RestController` is a specialized version of `@Controller` that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It is used to create RESTful web services and returns data directly in JSON or XML format.
